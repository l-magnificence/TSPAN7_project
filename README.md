# TSPAN7_project
Code files include codes used to analyze TCGA and CGGA sequencing data.

Processed_data files include some processed data in the analysis process for reproducing the figures of paper.

Raw TCGA RNA sequencing data can be accessed from https://toil-xena-hub.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/download/TcgaTargetGtex_rsem_gene_tpm.gz. 

Raw CGGA RNA sequencing data can be accessed from http://www.cgga.org.cn/index.jsp

Note that their size exceeds 1 Gb!

Publication state: in review

In R, you can `setwd` to the cloned repository and run `code` to get started quickly, or you can just explore on your own. 

Any additional information required to reanalyze the data reported in this project is available from the lead contact upon request.
